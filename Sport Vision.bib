	abstract = {Recent literature has demonstrated the usefulness of fitness and computer-based cognitive training as
a means to enhance cognition and brain function. However, it is unclear whether the combination of
fitness and cognitive training that results from years of extensive sport training also results in superior
performance on tests of cognitive processes. In this study we examine, in a quantitative meta-analysis
(k¼20), the relationship between expertise in sports and laboratory-based measures of cognition.We
found that athletes performed better on measures of processing speed and a category of varied
attentional paradigms, and athletes from interceptive sport types and males showed the largest effects.
Based on our results, more research should be done with higher-level cognitive tasks, such as tasks of
executive function and more varied sub-domains of visual attention. Furthermore, future studies
should incorporate more female athletes and use a diverse range of sport types and levels of expertise.},

	title = {Off-Court Generic Perceptual-Cognitive Training in Elite Volleyball Athletes: Task-Specific Effects and Levels of Transfer},
	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01599},
	abstract = {Background: The nature of perceptual-cognitive expertise in interactive sports has gained more and more scientific interest over the last two decades. Research to understand how this expertise can be developed has not been addressed profoundly yet. In approaches to study this with interventional designs, only a few studies have scrutinized several levels of transfer such as to the field. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of a generic off-court perceptual-cognitive training in elite volleyball players on three different levels: task-specific, near-transfer, and far-transfer effects. Based on overlapping cognitive processes between training and testing, we hypothesized task-specific improvements as well as positive near and far-transfer effects after a multiple-object tracking training intervention.
Methods: 22 volleyball experts completed an eight-week 3D-multiple-object tracking (3D-{MOT}) training intervention. A control group (n = 21; volleyball experts also) participated in regular ball practice only. Before and after training, both groups performed tests on the 3D-{MOT}, four near-transfer tests in cognitive domains, and a far-transfer, lab-based and volleyball-specific blocking test. 
Results: The results of the 2 x 2 {ANOVA} (group, time) showed significant interaction effects in the 3D-{MOT} task (F(1,40) = 93.10; p {\textless} .001; η\_p{\textasciicircum}2 = .70) and in two near-transfer tests (sustained attention: F(1,40) = 15.45; p {\textless}.001; η\_p{\textasciicircum}2 = .28; processing speed: F(1,40) = 12.15; p = .001; η\_p{\textasciicircum}2 = .23). No significant interaction effects were found in the far-transfer volleyball test.
Conclusions: Our study suggests positive effects in task-specific and two near-transfer tests of a perceptual-cognitive intervention in elite volleyball athletes. This supports a partial overlap in cognitive processing between practice and tests with the result of positive near-transfer. However, there are no significant effects in far-transfer testing. Although these current results are promising, it is still unclear how far-transfer effects of a generic perceptual-cognitive training intervention can be assured},

situations demand simultaneous attention to multiple, spatially separated objects/processes. But up till now,
there is still a lack of appropriate training programs to optimize the athletes’ attention-window.
Design and method: Two intervention studies were implemented to examine the change of the attention-window's
size of semi-professional team athletes and individual athletes through training in the lab (Study 1) and field
(Study 2).
Results: The results of both studies demonstrate a positive effect of computer-based cognitive training in the lab
and team training in the field on the expansion of athletes’ attention-window. Athletes showed an equal improvement
of attentional performance caused by training in the lab and field.
Conclusions: The findings provide important insights for training measures/programs and basic knowledge on
general cognition and attentional research},

	abstract = {The ability to devote attention simultaneously to multiple visual objects plays an important role in domains ranging from
everyday activities to the workplace. Yet, no studies have systematically explored the fixation strategies that optimize
attention to two spatially distinct objects. Assuming the two objects require attention nearly simultaneously, subjects either
could fixate one object or they could fixate between the objects. Studies measuring the breadth of attention have focused
almost exclusively on the former strategy, by having subjects simultaneously perform one attention-demanding task at
fixation and another in the periphery. We compared performance when one object was at fixation and the other was in the
periphery to a condition in which both objects were in the periphery and subjects fixated between them. Performance was
better with two peripheral stimuli than with one central and one peripheral stimulus, meaning that a strategy of fixating
between stimuli permitted greater attention breadth. Consistent with the idea that both measures tap attention breadth,
sport experts consistently outperformed novices with both fixation strategies. Our findings suggest a way to improve
performance when observers must pay attention to multiple objects across spatial regions. We discuss possible
explanations for this performance advantage},

	volume = {3},
	abstract = {There is considerable evidence that visual attention is concentrated at a single locus in the visual field, and that this locus can be moved independent of eye movements. Two studies are reported which suggest that, while certain aspects of attention require that locations be scanned serially, at least one
operation may be carried out in parallel across several independent loci in the visual field. That is the
operation of indexing features and tracking their identity. The studies show that: (a) subjects are able to
track a subset of up to 5 objects in a field of 10 identical randomly-moving objects in order to
distinguish a change in a target from a change in a distractor; and (b) when the speed and distance parameters
of the display are designed so that, on the basis of some very conservative assumptions about the speed of
attention movement and encoding times, the predicted performance of a serial scanning and updating
algorithm would not exceed about 40\% accuracy, subjects still manage to do the task with 87\% accuracy.
These findings are discussed in relation to an earlier, and independently motivated model of featurebinding-called the {FINST} model-which posits a primitive identity maintenance mechanism that indexes
and tracks a limited number of visual objects in parallel. These indexes are hypothesized to serve the function
of binding visual features prior to subsequent pattern recognition},

	abstract = {Is the effect of distractors in multiple object tracking dependent on the distractors
sharing the features of the targets? In experiment 1, observers tracked five targets among five
distractors that were identical to the targets and a number of additional distractors that were
either identical to or featurally distinct from the targets. Results showed that distractors that are
distinct from the targets in shape or color, or are stationary, impair tracking less than distractors
that are identical to the targets. However, tracking performance declined as the number of
distractors increased, even for featurally distinct distractors. Experiment 2 showed that distractors
that differ from the targets on two features impair tracking less than distractors that differ from the
targets on only one feature, but only when target tracking load is low. These results indicate that
shape, color, and motion information about distractors can be used to distinguish them from targets
during tracking, although even distractors with a different feature from the targets produce some
interference with tracking. These findings suggest that the effect of distractors on tracking is
dependent on top {\textasciicircum} down settings for target features.},

the constraints upon this multi-object attentional system are still debated. Results from multiple object tracking ({MOT})
experiments have been interpreted as revealing a fixed attentional capacity limit of 4 objects, while other evidence has
suggested that attentional capacity may be more fluid. Here, we investigated the influence of target stimulus factors, such
as speed and size, and of distractor filtering factors, such as number of distractors and screen density, on {MOT}
performance. Each factor had significant effects on capacity, producing values that ranged from above 6 objects down to
one object, depending on the task demands. Although our results support the view that crowding effects modulate the
effective capacity of attention, we also find evidence that central processes related to distractor suppression and target
enhancement modulate capacity.},

	doi = {10.1080/02701367.2017.1293228},
	abstract = {Purpose: Visual attention is essential in many areas ranging from everyday life situations to the
workplace. Different circumstances such as driving in traffic or participating in sports require immediate
adaptation to constantly changing situations and frequently the conscious perception of 2 objects
or scenes at the same time. Method: The attention window task, a measure of attentional breadth, in
which people must attend to 2 equally attention-demanding stimuli simultaneously, was introduced.
This article provides a narrative review of studies using this task and outlines different factors that
might influence the attention window. Results: Differences in the spatial distribution of attention
result, for example, from effects of age or physical activities as well as from emotional processes and
those affected by current motivation, while gender does not have any influence. The window is
represented as an ellipse with greater attentional breadth along the horizontal axis than the vertical
axis, and it is about 5 to 6 times smaller than the human visual field. Conclusion: Not only everyday
occurrences but also situations in sport games—for example, having an overview of the opponent,
teammates, and the ball—require the ability to pay visual attention to 2 peripheral objects and continuously changing situations. Therefore, the application or avoidance of different strategies and
factors is discussed to improve and adjust behavior in those situations.},
